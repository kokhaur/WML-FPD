GRAY LEVEL CO-OCCURENCE MATRIX EMBEDDED CLUSTERING STRATEGY TO DETECT AND CLASSIFY SUBTLE WHITE MATTER LESIONS IN FLAIR MRI
A solution for the white matter lesions segmentation on MRI, used as a quantitative tool for white matter lesions. This is a library of codes for white matter lesion segmentation and false positive detection, after trimmed mean outlier detection (TMOD) and landmark-based intensity standardization. Currently, this code supports Matlab 2012 and above
