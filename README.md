### About 

A solution for the white matter lesions segmentation on MRI, used as a quantitative tool for white matter lesions. This is a library of codes for white matter lesion segmentation and false positive detection, which required the input results after trimmed mean outlier detection (TMOD) and landmark-based intensity standardization process. Currently, this code supports Matlab 2012 and above
